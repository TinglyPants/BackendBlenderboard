The problem is, I need to implement a user system. The frontend details will be explained in that repo, but
for now all I need is for an "auth" key to be sent with every request if the user is logged in. In this "auth"
key, Ill have the JWT token with user data. This auth key will always be validated before allowing endpoint access.
If the user sends an invalid auth token, ill send a HTTP 401 unauthorized response to indicate this. If the user doesnt send 
an auth token at all, they will either be let through or denied access with a 401 depending on whether the endpoint requires
the user to be logged in or not.

I will handle this with express middleware.

In terms of actually logging in and signing up, Ill need to implement a userDB in mongo to handle that, with its own set of endpoints.
In fact, thats what I will be doing first on the backend.

This was less of an error and more just an insight into my plans.
