Problem: How do I make json web tokens and send them out for authentication?
Solution: dotenv and jsonwebtoken libraries

in the .env file is a secret token to secure my json web tokens. I will not be showing them anywhere for security reasons,
but here is a screenshot of what it would look like:

Okay thats not too bad. What do I need now?

Ill need to send a jwt when a user is created (sign up)
Ill need to send a jwt when a user logs in
Ill need to make middleware to handle authentication

Now, it is often considered best practice to have access tokens and refresh tokens
handled as different things. However, I will only be using access tokens for now.
When I convert my project into a microservice architecture later I will handle refresh
tokens as part of the API gateway.

Im not messing around with screenshots anymore unless needed, so check git commit history for stuff.
