Figure1 = API tester
Figure2 = code

Solution attempt one: Try{}Catch{} errors from mongoose query 
Figure3 = code

Solution attempt two: Perhaps because query is asynchronous, it is not being caught in try catch. Wrapping in IIFE

Solution attempt three: Making entire request asynchronous
This partially worked
Figure5 = code

New problem: when ID is valid but not found, undefined is sent.
Solution: If statement.
This worked.
