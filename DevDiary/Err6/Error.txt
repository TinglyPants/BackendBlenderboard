Multer does not appear to be recognising the files existing when the request is received.
Figure1 = backend code
Figure2 = backend server logs

solution: I think the frontend is sending incorrectly.
Notice in figure2 that req.body has all of the keys, and also that images is a string "[object FileList]". This is odd.
Im going to change the frontend code to solve this, so git will store the solution in that frontend repo but the report will be here.
Yes, i needed to append individual files instead of the whole list.

Figure3 = frontend code
Figure4 = backend server logs afterwards
