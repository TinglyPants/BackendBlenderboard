Ok, I need to change how the model system works. 
The following is a plan for what i need to do and how imma do it

Model needs to be nested as a separate object in the post
models need the following now (* indicates required):

Mesh * (if model included ofc)
Alpha map
Ambient occlusion map
Bump map
displacement map
emissive map
metalness map
normal map
tangent or object space (bool) (* if normal map)
roughness map
albedo map

Im going to change the postSchema and modify the post creation endpoint and post reading endpoint to accommodate this.
Once that is done, I will be able to work on it from the frontend and my job here will be done.
